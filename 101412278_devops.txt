-- IMPORTANT --

| Assignment Policy
- All assignments must be submitted on the due date based on an instruction given by the
professor. Late assignment will be penalized 20% per day to a maximum of seven days,
the weekend included unless the student has notified the professor (via email, phone or in
person) ahead of the due date that he/she has a valid reason for a late submission.

| Test Policy
- Students must complete tests and the final exam on the assigned day. If unable to
complete the test/exam as scheduled, students are required to notify the professor at least
three days prior to the date, so alternative arrangements can be made. Failure to comply
with this policy may result in a zero grade.
- There will be no makeup quiz and lab exercises. If you anticipate missing more than two
quizzes or lab exercises for serious, major reasons, notify your professor beforehand.
