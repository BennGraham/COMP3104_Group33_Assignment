DevOps in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

Overview

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process that guides 
the planning, development, testing, and deployment of software.
Integrating DevOps into the SDLC makes these stages faster, more reliable, and more collaborative.

DevOps Integration

In traditional SDLC models, developers and operations teams often work separately. DevOps bridges that gap by:

Automating builds, tests, and deployments

Enabling Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD)

Improving communication between development and IT operations

Benefits

By applying DevOps within the SDLC, teams can:

Release software updates more frequently

Detect and fix issues earlier

Improve product stability and customer satisfaction
